HERO BACKGROUND IMAGE
=====================

To use your own photo as the wedding app's hero background:

1. Choose your image (coffee estate, venue, or any photo you like)
   - Recommended: landscape orientation, at least 800px wide
   - Formats: .jpg, .png, or .webp

2. Rename it to: venue-photo.jpg  OR  venue-photo.png
   (Both formats are supported — use whichever you have)

3. Copy the file into this folder (the "public" folder)
   - Same folder as firebase-messaging-sw.js and manifest.json

4. Restart or refresh the app — your image will appear as the background!

If no image is found, a default coffee estate photo is shown instead.
